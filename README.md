> A Chrome extension for downloading your ChatGPT history to PNG or PDF

## Why did I build this extention?

When you try to share some of your chats with the AI, it's very difficult to take a snapshot of the entire chat. On the other hand, Chat GPT history is sometimes not available so you may want to save your conversation for later. This extension adds the functionality to export it to an image or a PDF file.

## How to install it

### Install on Chrome

1. Download `ChatGPT-ConversationDownloader.rar` from the latest release in [releases page](https://github.com/Charutito/ChatGPT-ConversationDownloader/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file to extract the extension files.
3. Go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
4. Turn on Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top-right corner of the page.
5. Click the `Load unpacked` button and select the directory where you extracted the extension files.
6. ChatGPT Conversation Downloader should now be installed and active on the ChatGPT website (https://chat.openai.com/chat).
